<p><strong>Freemit Terms of Service</strong></p>
<p>Last Update: Monday 16 May 2016</p>
</center>
    
<p>This Terms of Service (&ldquo;<strong>Agreement</strong>&rdquo;) is a contract between you (&ldquo;<strong>you</strong>&rdquo; or &ldquo;<strong>your</strong>&rdquo;) and Freeport Mobile, Inc. (&ldquo;<strong>Freeport</strong> <strong>Mobile</strong>,&rdquo; &ldquo;<strong>we</strong>,&rdquo; &ldquo;<strong>us</strong>,&rdquo; or &ldquo;<strong>our</strong>&rdquo;) and applies to your use of our website, mobile application, and all other services described herein (collectively, the &ldquo;<strong>Service</strong>&rdquo;). By using the Service, you agree that you have read, agree with, and accept all the terms and conditions in this Agreement. If you do not agree to any of the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement, or any subsequent modification to the Agreement, you may not access or use any of the Service and must cancel your Freemit Account.</p>

<h1><strong><strong>Eligibility</strong></strong></h1>
<p>In order to use the Service, you first must register. As part of your registration and use of the Service, you represent and warrant that: </p>
<ul>
<ul>
<li>You are of the legal age of majority in your jurisdiction, but in all events at least 18 years old; </li>
<li>You have full authority to enter into this Agreement; </li>
<li>You will not be violating any laws or regulations by registering with us, entering into or by performing any part of this Agreement, or by otherwise using the Service; </li>
<li>You are not an agent acting for an undisclosed principal or third party beneficiary. In the event that you are acting for a third party, you agree to provide us with certified copies of identification evidence of such authorizations that you have received from the third party and obtain our express approval before acting on that third party&rsquo;s behalf; </li>
<li>All information provided by you as part of your registration and use of the Service is accurate and complete, and you undertake to promptly notify us of any changes to such information </li>
</ul>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><em>You will ensure that your contact details provided at registration remain accurate and up to date. We will use those contact details to contact you wherever required under this Agreement or in connection with the Service. You may update your contact details at any time by logging in to the Service App.</em></li>
</ul>

<h1><strong>Description of Service</strong></h1>

<p>Freeport Mobile provides the Service as part of a limited beta to test features as preparation for a future public release. You can access the Service through Freeport Mobile&rsquo;s mobile application (the &ldquo;<strong>Freemit App</strong>&rdquo;) by installing that app on your mobile device and creating an account. The Service allows you to engage in the following transactions: (i) deposit and withdraw money from your Freemit Account, (ii) exchange one currency type for another currency type, and (iii) send and receive money from other Freeport Mobile users. Each of these Freemit Beta Service is described in detail below.</p>
<p>The Service, as described herein, may be amended by us at any time, upon notice, as set forth in the Agreement. Moreover, we retain full discretion to refuse to accept any user or to complete any instruction to deposit, withdrawal, exchange, or transfer money at any time.</p>

<h2><strong><strong>Creating a Freemit Account</strong></strong></h2>

<p>In order to use any of the Service, you must create a Freemit account (&ldquo;<strong>Freemit Account</strong>&rdquo;), provide information required to verify your identity, and affirm your acceptance of this Agreement. Upon successful completion of the registration process, Freeport Mobile will establish your Freemit Account. Freeport Mobile may, in our sole discretion, refuse to allow you to establish a Freemit Account, or limit the number of Freemit Accounts that a single user may establish and maintain at any time.</p>
<h2><strong>2.2. Identity Verification</strong></h2>
<p>In order to use the Service, you will be required to provide Freeport Mobile with certain personal information including, but not limited to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Your full legal name;</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Physical home address;</li>
<li>Date of birth;</li>
<li>Country of birth and/or current nationality; and</li>
<li>Email address. </li>
</ul>
<p>Freeport Mobile may also require you to answer certain questions or take actions in order to verify your identity, provide the Service to you, or comply with applicable law. In submitting this or any other personal information as may be required, you verify that the information is accurate and authentic, and you agree to update Freeport Mobile if any information changes.</p>
<h2><strong>2.3 Account Balances</strong></h2>
<p>Your account shows the balance and effect of all money transactions on your Freemit Account. </p>
<p>You do not need to maintain a balance in your account in order to complete any Transaction. If you do hold a balance, Freeport Mobile will hold your funds separate from its corporate funds, will not use your funds for its operating expenses or any other corporate purposes, and will not voluntarily make your funds available to its creditors in the event of bankruptcy. </p>
<p>Freeport Mobile is not a bank or other chartered depository institution. Funds held by us or our service providers (including any bank service providers) in connection with the processing of transactions are not deposit obligations and are not insured for the benefit of the user by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or any other governmental agency. Funds held in balance are an ancillary function of enabling money transmission and not for other benefit.</p>
<h3><strong>2.3.1 Assignment of Interest to Freeport Mobile</strong></h3>
<p>You agree that you will not receive interest or other earnings on the funds that Freeport Mobile handles and places in pooled accounts. We do not typically receive interest on funds held for its users. However, in consideration for your use of the service, you irrevocably transfer and assign to Freeport Mobile any ownership right that you may have in any interest that may accrue on funds held in pooled accounts. This assignment applies only to interest earned on your funds, and nothing in this Agreement grants us any ownership right to the principal of the funds you maintain within your Freemit Account. </p>

<h2><strong><strong>Transfer</strong></strong></h2>

<p>As part of the Service offered in connection with your Freemit Account, you can send money held in your account to third parties, and receive money into your account from third parties (collectively a &ldquo;<strong>Transfer</strong>&rdquo;). You may initiate a Transfer by going to the Freemit App, choosing to send or request, and entering the requisite information regarding the sender or recipient and the amount to be transferred.</p>

<h3><strong><strong>Reserve the right to refuse</strong></strong></h3>

<p>Freeport Mobile reserves the right to refuse to process or to cancel any pending Transfer as required by law or in response to a subpoena, court order, or other binding government order.</p>

<h3><strong><strong>Freeport Mobile processes transfer</strong></strong></h3>

<p>Freeport Mobile will process a Transfer according to the instructions received from its users and we do not guarantee the identity of any user, receiver, requested, or other party. You should verify all transaction information prior to submitting instructions to Freeport Mobile.</p>

<h3><strong><strong>Initiate Transfer with a Recipient without a Freemit Account</strong></strong></h3>

<p>If you initiate a Transfer by entering a recipient&rsquo;s email address and Freeport Mobile will attempt to confirm that the email address is valid; however, Freeport Mobile cannot confirm that the email address belongs to the intended recipient. In the event you initiate a Transfer by entering the recipient&rsquo;s email address and the recipient does not have an existing Freemit Account, Freeport Mobile will email the recipient and invite them to open a Freemit Account. If the designated recipient does not open a Freemit Account within 14 days, Freeport Mobile will cancel the Transfer and return any money to your account.</p>

<h3><strong><strong>Additional Verification Procedures for Transactions</strong></strong></h3>

<p>Certain Transfers are also subject to the successful completion of the additional verification steps. Freeport Mobile will notify you if any Transfer requires additional verification steps.</p>
<ul>

Freeport Mobile reserves the right to charge you costs and fees associated with Enhanced Due Diligence, provided that we notify you in advance of any such charges. In our sole discretion, we may refuse to raise your limits or we may lower your limits at a subsequent time even if you have completed Enhanced Due Diligence.</p>

<h2><strong><strong>Exchange Rates</strong></strong></h2>

<p>The Freemit Service allows you to participate in a Transfer that requires the exchange of one currency for another currency (&ldquo;<strong>Exchange</strong>&rdquo;). We will always specify the exchange rate applicable at the time you submit a Transfer instruction that requires an Exchange. Freeport Mobile relies on aggregated third party information sources, and we do not guarantee that the rates match any particular benchmark source at any given time.</p>
